# Coronavirus (Covid-19) Data in the United States (FORKED)

This is a data fork from the [NY Times covid-19-data repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) for parsing and integration into the [COVID-19 dashboard](https://cypressriveradvisors.shinyapps.io/covid-19/) for [Cypress River Advisors](https://www.cypressriveradvisors.com/). 

This file contains data files under /parsed_data/ in feather format for cross compatibility between the Python parser and the Shiny R framework that visualizes it and the load speed of the data in the web app. The parser to generate these files may also be found here.
